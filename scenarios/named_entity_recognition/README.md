# Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of detecting and classifying
real-world objects mentioned in text. Common named entities include person
names, locations, organizations, etc. The state-of-the art NER methods include
combining Long Short-Term Memory neural network with Conditional Random Field
(LSTM-CRF) and pretrained language models like BERT. NER can be used for
information extraction and filtering. It also plays an important role in other
NLP tasks like question answering and text summarization.
