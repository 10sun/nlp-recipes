# Text Classification

Text classification is a supervised learning method of learning and predicting the category or the class of a document given its text content. The state-of-the-art methods are based on neural networks of different architectures as well as pretrained language models or word embeddings. Text classification is a core task in natural language Processing and has numerous applications such as sentiment analysis, document indexing in digital libraries, hate speech detection, and general-purpose categorization in medical, academic, legal, and many other domains.
