# Natural Language Inference (NLI)  
Natural Language Inference (NLI) or Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) is the
task of classifying a pair of premise and hypothesis sentences into three
classes: contradiction, neutral, and entailment. For example,  

|Premise|Hypothesis|Label|
|-------|----------|-----|
|A man inspects the uniform of a figure in some East Asian country.|The man is sleeping.|contradiction|
|An older and younger man smiling.|Two men are smiling and laughing at the cats playing on the floor.|neutral|
|A soccer game with multiple males playing.|Some men are playing a sport.|entailment|

NLI is one of many NLP tasks that require robust compositional sentence understanding, but it's simpler compared to other tasks like question answering and machine translation.
