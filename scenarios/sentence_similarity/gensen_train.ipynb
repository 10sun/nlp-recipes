    "# GenSen with Pytorch\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will train a GenSen model for the sentence similarity task. We use the [SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) dataset in this example. For a more detailed walkthrough about data processing jump to [SNLI Data Prep](../01-prep-data/snli.ipynb). A quickstart version of this notebook can be found [here](../00-quick-start/)\n",

    "### What is GenSen?\n",
    "\n",
    "GenSen[\\[1\\]](#References) is a technique to learn general purpose, fixed-length representations of sentences via multi-task training. GenSen is to combine the benefits of These representations are useful for transfer and low-resource learning. GenSen is trained on several data sources with multiple training objectives on over 100 milion sentences.\n",

    "### Why GenSen?\n",
    "\n",
