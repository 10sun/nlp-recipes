## What is sentence similarity?

Sentence similarity or semantic textual similarity is to determine how similar two pieces of texts are and a measure of the degree to which two pieces of text express the same meaning. This can take the form of assigning a score from 1 to 5. Related tasks are parahrase or duplicate identification. Sentence similarity is normally calculated by the following two steps: 1. obtaining the embeddings of the sentences, 2. taking the cosine similarity between them as shown in the following figure:
