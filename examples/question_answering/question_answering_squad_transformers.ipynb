    "This notebook demonstrates how to fine tune [pretrained BERT model](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers) for extractive question answering task. Utility functions and classes in the NLP Best Practices repo are used to facilitate data preprocessing, model training, model scoring, result postprocessing, and model evaluation. \n",

    "BERT[\\[1\\]](#References) is a powerful pre-trained lanaguage model that can be used for multiple NLP tasks, including text classification, question answering, named entity recognition, etc. It's able to achieve state of the art performance with only a few epochs of fine tuning on task specific datasets.  \n",
    "The figure below illustrates how BERT can be fine tuned for extractive question answering task. The question and paragraph tokens are concatenated as a single input token sequence with a special token [SEP] between them. For the paragraph tokens, BERT predicts the probabilities of each token being the start and end of the answer span. The tokens with the highest sum of starting probability and ending probability define the span of the predicted answer\n",

      "Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude. Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time. The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between \"cellular\" and \"humoral\" theories of immunity. According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff, it was cells – more precisely, phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism’s “humors” rather than its cells.\n",
