# Text Classification

Text classification is a supervised learning method of learning and predicting the category or the class of a document given its text content. The state-of-the-art methods are based on neural networks of different architectures as well as pretrained language models or word embeddings. Text classification is a core task in natural language Processing and has numerous applications such as sentiment analysis, document indexing in digital libraries, hate speech detection, and general-purpose categorization in medical, academic, legal, and many other domains.


## Summary

The following summarizes each notebook for Text Classification. Each notebook provides more details and guiding in principles on building state of the art models.

|Notebook|Runs Local|Description|
|---|---|---|
|[BERT for TC with MNLI](tc_mnli_bert.ipynb)| Yes| A notebook which walks through fine-tuning and evaluating a pretrained BERT model on a subset of the MultiNLI dataset|
|[BERT for TC on AzureML](tc_bert_azureml.ipynb) | No |A notebook which walks through fine-tuning and evaluating pretrained BERT model on a distributed setup with AzureML. |
