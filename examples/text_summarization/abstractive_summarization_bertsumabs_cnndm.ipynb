    "### Abstractive Summarization\n",
    "Abstractive summarization is the task of taking an input text and summarizing its content in a shorter output text. In contrast to extractive summarization, abstractive summarization doesn't take sentences directly from the input text, instead, rephrases the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BertSumAbs\n",
    "\n",
    "BertSumAbs refers to an BERT-based abstractive summarization algorithm  in [Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08345) with [published examples](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm). It uses the pretrained BERT model as encoder and finetune both encoder and decoder on a specific labeled summarization dataset like [CNN/DM dataset](https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-summary). \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the comparison of architecture of the original BERT model (left) and BERTSUM (right), which BertSumAbs is built upon. For BERTSUM, a input document is split into sentences, and [CLS] and [SEP] tokens are inserted before and after each sentence. This resulting sequence is followed by the summation of three kinds of embeddings for each token before feeding into the transformer layers. The positional embedding used in BertSumAbs enables input length of more than 512, which is the  maximum input length for BERT model. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the architecture only shows the encoder part. For decoder, BertSumAbs also uses a transformer with multiple layers and random initialization. As pretrained weights are used in the encoder, there is a mismatch in encoder and decoder which may result in unstable finetuning. Therefore, in fine tuning, BertSumAbs uses seperate optimizers for encoder and decoder, each uses its own scheduling. In text generation, techniques like trigram blocking and beam search can be used to improve model accuracy.\n",
