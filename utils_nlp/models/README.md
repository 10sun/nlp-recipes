### Models
The models submodule contains implementations of various algorithms that can be used in addition to external packages to evaluate and develop new natural language processing systems. A description of which algorithms are used in each scenario can be found on [this table](../../README.md#content)

This includes:
* BERT
* GenSen
* Pretrained embeddings (Word2Vec,
fastText,
GloVe)
* Pytorch's conditional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
