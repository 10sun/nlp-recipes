## [Common](common)

This submodule contains high-level common utilities used across multiple algorithms and frameworks as well as helper functions for managing aspects of different frameworks like pytorch.  
For example, [pytorch_utils.py](./pytorch_utils.py) contains utilities to interact with PyTorch like getting a device architecture (cpu or gpu), moves a model to a specific device, and handles parallelism when multiple gpus are present.
