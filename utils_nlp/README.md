# NLP Utilities

This module (**utils_nlp**) contains functions to simplify common tasks used when developing and evaluating NLP systems. For more details about what functions are available and how to use them, please review the doc-strings provided with the code.

## Submodules
The utilities package is made up of several high-level submodules for common utilies, datasets, evaluation and model interpretability. It also includes code that make it easy to interact with various platforms and frameworks.  

For more information about the individual submodules, find links below:  

- [Azure Machine Learning](./azureml/README.md) - Contains Azure Machine Learning specific utilities  
- [Common](./common/README.md) - Contains common helper utilities such as  
        - `Timer`: A timer object that helps with timing execution runs.  
        - `get_device` and `move_to_device`: Pytorch specific utilities that help determine the compute device and handle moving of models across various types of compute respectively. 
- [Dataset](./dataset/README.md) - Contains dataset definition and sources  
- [Evaluation (Eval)](./eval/README.md) - Contains metric and accuracy evaluation utilities     
- [Models](./models/README.md) - Contains implementation of algorithms used     
- [Interpreter](./interpreter/README.md) - Contains utilities to explain hidden states of models i.e. **model interpretability**. 


## Semantic Versioning

This library is configured to use
[setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/) to automatically get package version from git commit histories.

> NOTE: **There shouldn't be any references to manually coded versions**.

Verify what git tag to use by running:

```bash
python setup.py --version
```
It should look something like `0.1.0.dev4+gdfedba7.d20190209`

Using the information above the master branch, after a merge commit, can be _**Tagged**_ with the above semantic version `0.1.0` (ignoring the `dev4+gdfedba7.d20190209`)  

For example: 

    git tag v0.1.0  

Now verify the semantic version for the package:

    python setup.py --version


All new merged commit on master must have a
   [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) release version with an
   accompanying tag.  TL;DR:
   * `major.minor.patch`
   * Patch is for bugfix
   * Minor is for new features
   * Major is for backwards-incompatible changes
   * tags should be of the form `v0.1.2`  

Installing this library into another clean git repository with a tag version, you should get a nice version like `0.2.1`.  

However, if you inspect the `__version__` in this repo,
you'll get a nice **'dirty'** version number like `'0.2.1.dev0+g850a76d.d20180908'`.  

This is useful for debugging, building sphinx docs in dev and so on.   

You should never have to specify a version manually except just tagging your commit from the tag calculation generated by running  

    python setup.py --version
